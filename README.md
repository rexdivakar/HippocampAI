# HippocampAI — Autonomous Memory Engine for LLM Agents

HippocampAI turns raw conversations into a curated long-term memory vault for your AI assistants. It extracts, scores, deduplicates, stores, and retrieves user memories so agents can stay personal, consistent, and context-aware across sessions.

- Plug-and-play `MemoryClient` API with built-in pipelines for extraction, dedupe, consolidation, and importance decay
- Hybrid retrieval that fuses dense vectors, BM25, reciprocal-rank fusion, reranking, recency, and importance signals
- Works fully self-hosted via Qdrant + Ollama or in the cloud via OpenAI (and other providers) with the same code paths
- Ships with CLI and web chat UIs, typed models, scheduled maintenance jobs, and production-grade logging/config

## Why HippocampAI

- **Persistent personalization** – store preferences, facts, goals, habits, and events per user with importance scoring and decay
- **Reliable retrieval** – hybrid ranking surfaces the right memories even when queries are vague or drift semantically
- **Automatic hygiene** – extractor, deduplicator, consolidator, and scorer keep the memory base uncluttered
- **Local-first** – run everything on your infra with open models, or flip a switch to activate OpenAI for higher quality
- **Extensible Python SDK** – customize every stage without being locked to a hosted API

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rexdivakar/HippocampAI.git
cd HippocampAI
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py          # creates .env, initializes Qdrant collections
```

Configure the generated `.env`:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
QDRANT_URL=http://localhost:6333
LLM_PROVIDER=ollama       # or openai
LLM_MODEL=qwen2.5:7b-instruct
```

Start the chat clients:

```bash
python cli_chat.py alice
python web_chat.py        # open http://localhost:5000
```

Run the interactive example suite:

```bash
./run_example.sh
```

## Embed HippocampAI in Your Agent

```python
from hippocampai import MemoryClient

client = MemoryClient(user_id="user_123")

client.remember(
    text="I prefer oat milk in my coffee.",
    user_id="user_123",
    session_id="morning_chat",
    type="preference"
)

memories = client.recall(
    query="How should I serve their coffee?",
    user_id="user_123",
    session_id="morning_chat",
    k=3
)

for item in memories:
    print(item.memory.text, item.score)
```

- `remember` scores importance, checks for duplicates, stores vectors + payload in Qdrant.
- `recall` rebuilds BM25 on demand, routes queries, fuses vector + lexical hits, reranks, and blends final scores.

---

## Feature Highlights

- **Memory extraction** – heuristics + optional LLM convert conversation logs into structured memories.
- **Deduplication & consolidation** – detect near duplicates via embeddings + rerankers; merge clusters into concise summaries.
- **Importance decay** – configurable half-life per memory type plus recency/access boosts keep results fresh.
- **Hybrid retrieval** – vector search + BM25 + reciprocal-rank fusion + cross-encoder rerank → final recency/importance weighted set.
- **Session management** – track sessions, keep summaries, and bias retrieval toward the active conversation.
- **Jobs & tooling** – built-in cron schedules for decay/consolidation/snapshots; CLI commands for maintenance.

## HippocampAI vs Mem0 and Others

| Capability                | HippocampAI                                         | Mem0 / hosted memory APIs                    |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Deployment                | Self-hosted first (Qdrant + Ollama), cloud optional| SaaS-first, hosted vector memory             |
| Customization             | Full Python pipeline control, extend every stage   | Limited to exposed API surface               |
| Retrieval                 | Hybrid fusion (vector + BM25 + rerank + decay)     | Typically vector-first with optional rerank  |
| Memory hygiene            | Built-in extraction, dedupe, consolidation, decay  | Generally manual or implicit                 |
| Data residency & control  | Your infra, your compliance boundaries             | Stored in provider cloud                     |
| Setup effort              | Requires Qdrant + (optional) local models          | Minimal—call REST API                        |

HippocampAI is ideal when you need ownership, customization, or offline capability. Mem0 (and similar SaaS tools) win when you want zero infrastructure and accept managed trade-offs.
