# LLMEM Project

## Step1: Set Up Qdrant

1. Set up a Python project structure with proper folders (src, tests, config)
2. Create a Qdrant client wrapper class that:
   - Connects to Qdrant running on 192.168.1.120 with port 6334
   - Creates three collections: "personal_facts", "conversation_history", and "knowledge_base"
   - Each collection should store 384-dimensional vectors (for sentence-transformers)
   - Include proper error handling

## Step2: Set Up Embedding Generation

Create an embedding service for my memory system that:

1. Uses sentence-transformers library
2. Implements a class called EmbeddingService with methods:
   - generate_embedding(text) -> returns vector
   - generate_batch_embeddings(texts) -> returns list of vectors

3. Use the 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' model (384 dimensions, fast and efficient)
4. Include caching to avoid re-computing embeddings for same text
5. Add proper error handling and logging
6. Make it easy to switch models later if needed

Include detailed comments explaining each part.

## Step3: Create Memory Storage Module

Build a MemoryStore class that handles storing memories in Qdrant. It should:

1. Have methods to:
   - store_memory(text, memory_type, metadata) -> stores a memory with its embedding
   - store_batch_memories(memories) -> stores multiple memories efficiently

2. Memory metadata should include:
   - user_id (string)
   - memory_type (preference, fact, goal, habit, event, context)
   - importance (1-10 scale)
   - timestamp (datetime)
   - category (work, personal, learning, health, etc.)
   - session_id (string)
   - confidence (0.0-1.0)

3. Automatically generate embeddings using the EmbeddingService
4. Return the stored memory ID
5. Include proper validation and error handling
6. Add logging for debugging

Use the Qdrant client from Step 1 and EmbeddingService from Step 2.

## Step4: Basic Memory Retrieval

Create a MemoryRetriever class that fetches relevant memories from Qdrant:

1. Implement methods:
   - search_memories(query, limit=10, filters=None) -> returns relevant memories
   - get_memory_by_id(memory_id) -> returns specific memory
   - get_memories_by_filter(filters, limit=50) -> returns filtered memories

2. The search should:
   - Generate embedding for the query
   - Search Qdrant using vector similarity
   - Apply any metadata filters (user_id, memory_type, date range, etc.)
   - Return results with similarity scores

3. Format returned memories as clean dictionaries with:
   - memory_id
   - text
   - metadata
   - similarity_score

4. Include filtering by user_id by default (for multi-user support)
5. Add proper error handling and logging

Use the Qdrant client and EmbeddingService from previous steps.

# Phase 2: Intelligence Layer

## Step 5: Memory Extraction with AI

Build a MemoryExtractor class that uses Claude API to extract memories from conversations:

1. Create a class with method:
   - extract_memories(conversation_text, user_id) -> returns list of extracted memories

2. Send conversation to Claude API with this instruction:
   "Analyze this conversation and extract important memories. For each memory, provide:
   - text: the actual memory statement
   - memory_type: (preference, fact, goal, habit, event, context)
   - importance: 1-10 score
   - category: (work, personal, learning, health, etc.)
   - confidence: 0.0-1.0 (how certain are you about this memory)

   Only extract genuinely important information worth remembering long-term.
   Return as JSON array."

3. Parse Claude's JSON response
4. Validate the extracted memories
5. Return structured memory objects ready for storage
6. Handle API errors gracefully
7. Add rate limiting awareness

Include the full prompt template and response parsing logic. Use environment variable for API key.

## Step 6: Deduplication System

Create a MemoryDeduplicator class that prevents storing duplicate memories:

1. Implement method:
   - check_for_duplicates(new_memory_text, user_id, similarity_threshold=0.88) -> returns duplicate info

2. Before storing any memory, this should:
   - Generate embedding for new memory
   - Search existing memories for similar ones (above threshold)
   - Return any duplicates found with their similarity scores

3. Add method:
   - should_update_or_skip(new_memory, existing_memory) -> returns decision

4. Use Claude API to decide if new memory should:
   - Replace existing (it's an update)
   - Merge with existing (complementary info)
   - Skip storing (true duplicate)
   - Store as new (different enough)

5. Provide clear reasoning for each decision
6. Include the prompt template for Claude

Use MemoryRetriever and Claude API from previous steps.

## Step 7: Memory Update System

Build a MemoryUpdater class that handles updating existing memories:

1. Implement methods:
   - update_memory(memory_id, new_text, reason) -> updates existing memory
   - merge_memories(memory_ids) -> combines multiple memories into one
   - mark_memory_outdated(memory_id, reason) -> flags old memory

2. When updating, maintain version history:
   - Store previous text in metadata
   - Track update timestamp
   - Record reason for update
   - Increment version number

3. Add method:
   - resolve_conflict(old_memory, new_memory) -> uses Claude to determine action

4. The conflict resolution should ask Claude:
   "Old memory: [text]
   New memory: [text]

   Do these conflict? If yes, how should I handle it?
   Options: update (new replaces old), merge (combine info), separate (both valid)
   Return JSON with decision and reasoning."

5. Implement the chosen resolution
6. Update importance scores based on recency and updates

Include proper error handling and logging.

## Step 8: Importance Scoring

Create an ImportanceScorer class that calculates memory importance:

1. Implement method:
   - calculate_importance(memory_text, memory_type, user_context) -> returns score 1-10

2. Use Claude API with this logic:
   "Rate the importance of remembering this for a personal AI assistant:
   Memory: [text]
   Type: [memory_type]
   Context: [user_context]

   Score 1-10 where:
   10 = Critical (core preferences, identity, key goals)
   7-9 = Very important (significant facts, ongoing projects)
   4-6 = Moderately important (useful context, occasional needs)
   1-3 = Low importance (trivial facts, one-time mentions)

   Return JSON: {score: X, reasoning: 'why'}"

3. Add method:
   - decay_importance(memory_age_days, current_importance, access_count) -> returns adjusted score

4. Implement decay logic:
   - Reduce importance over time (except for permanent facts)
   - Boost importance if frequently accessed
   - Keep importance high for recently updated memories

5. Update importance scores periodically in background

Include the complete prompt template and decay algorithm.

# Phase 3: Advanced Features

1. Add method:
   - smart_search(query, user_id, context_type=None, limit=10) -> returns ranked memories

2. Implement ranking algorithm that combines:
   - Semantic similarity (50% weight)
   - Importance score (30% weight)
   - Recency (20% weight)
   - Boost for frequently accessed memories

3. Add context-aware retrieval:
   - If context_type="work", prioritize work-related memories
   - If context_type="personal", prioritize personal memories
   - If context_type="casual", prioritize personality/preference memories

4. Implement re-ranking:
   - First, get 30 candidates from Qdrant (semantic search)
   - Then re-rank using custom scoring formula
   - Return top N results

5. Add method:
   - get_context_for_query(query, user_id) -> returns optimal memories for this specific query

6. Include detailed logging of ranking decisions

Show the complete scoring formula and explain the reasoning.

## Step 10: Session Manager

   - Use Claude API to generate session summary
   - Extract key discussion points
   - Identify important decisions or outcomes
   - Store session summary with embedding in conversation_history collection

3. Prompt for Claude should be:
   "Summarize this conversation session:
   [conversation history]

   Provide:
   - Main topics discussed (bullet points)
   - Key decisions or outcomes
   - Important context for future reference
   - Overall tone (problem-solving, casual, learning, etc.)

   Return as JSON."

4. Add method:
   - get_recent_sessions(user_id, days=7) -> returns recent session summaries

5. Link individual memories to their session_id
6. Include session metadata: start_time, end_time, message_count, topics

Use the Claude API and storage components from earlier.

## Step 11: Memory Consolidation

Create a MemoryConsolidator class that merges similar memories:

1. Implement method:
   - consolidate_memories(user_id, similarity_threshold=0.85) -> consolidates similar memories

2. Process:
   - Find clusters of similar memories using Qdrant search
   - For each cluster, use Claude API to merge them

3. Prompt for Claude:
   "Consolidate these similar memories into one comprehensive memory:
   [list of similar memories]

   Create a single memory that:
   - Captures all important information from all memories
   - Removes redundancy
   - Maintains accuracy
   - Is clear and concise

   Return JSON: {consolidated_text: '...', memories_to_delete: [ids]}"

4. Add method:
   - schedule_consolidation(user_id, frequency_days=7) -> runs periodic consolidation

5. Before deleting old memories:
   - Archive them (mark as archived, don't actually delete)
   - Keep audit trail

6. Update importance of consolidated memory (take max importance from cluster)

Include safety checks to prevent over-consolidation.

## Step 12: Memory Analytics

Build a MemoryAnalytics class for insights about stored memories:

   - get_category_breakdown(user_id) -> memories by category

2. Statistics to calculate:
   - Total memories stored
   - Memories by type (facts, preferences, goals, etc.)
   - Average importance score
   - Most frequently accessed memories
   - Recent memory growth rate

3. Add method:
   - identify_patterns(user_id) -> uses Claude to find conversation patterns

4. Claude prompt for pattern analysis:
   "Analyze these memory summaries and identify patterns:
   [memory summaries]

   Find:
   - Recurring topics or interests
   - Common questions or needs
   - Behavioral patterns (time-based, situational)
   - Evolving preferences or goals

   Return insights as JSON."

5. Create visualization-ready data (JSON format for charts)
6. Include export function for all analytics

Use aggregation on Qdrant metadata and Claude for insights.
