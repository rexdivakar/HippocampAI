"""Local backend - placeholder for the existing MemoryClient implementation.

The LocalBackend is actually the existing MemoryClient implementation.
This file exists for consistency with the backend abstraction pattern.
When mode='local', MemoryClient uses its own implementation directly.

# The local backend is implemented directly in client.py
# This file is kept for documentation and future extensibility
